            <p>My name is Josh Stothard and have been sports focused all my life, I played football for 15 years, continued to stay as active as I can and tried any sport which I wanted to give a go. This included: golf, tennis, lawn bowls, darts and general gym going. So I have a varied background of sports and focuses which I can put to use. I studied Sports all the way up until I graduated at the University of Bedfordshire where I graduated with a 2:1 in Sports Therapy. I want to utilise my degree and fulfill my desire to help people, I take pride in everything I do and always aim for the highest standards to ensure the happiness of yourself and also for myself. I am first aid trained and in September I will have had both my Covid-19 vaccines.</p> </div>
